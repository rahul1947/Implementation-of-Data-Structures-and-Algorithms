Collection for all the projects in Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms course.

Following is the detailed list of each project:

## A. Long Projects: 

|    `Title`     |    `End_Date`    | `Description` | 
|:---------------|-----------------:|:--------------| 
| [LP1: Integer Arithmetic with Arbitrarily Large Numbers](https://github.com/rahul1947/LP1-Integer-Arithmetic-with-Arbitrarily-Large-Numbers)  | Sept 23, 2018 | Array-based implementation of Calculator of very large integers with the length of the numbers as large as 2,147,483,647 (2^31 - 1), with Postfix and Infix evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions. | 
| [LP2: Skip List Implementation](https://github.com/rahul1947/LP2-Skip-List-Implementation)  | Oct 14, 2018 | Skip Lists: A generalization of sorted linked lists for implementing Dictionary ADT (insert, delete, find, min, floor, ceiling) in O(log n) expected time per operation. And competing with balanced search trees like AVL, Red-Black, and B-Trees. | 
| [LP3: Multidimensional Search(MDS) Implementation](https://github.com/rahul1947/LP3-Multidimensional-Search-MDS-Implementation)  | Nov 04, 2018 | Implementation of MDS for a website seller (like Amazon), having thousands of Products (each with its own ID, Price, Description). Organizing data into a TreeMap (Red-Black Tree), used HashMap, and HashSet to achieve insertion, deletion, search, modification efficiently. | 
| [LP4: PERT, Enumeration of Topological Orders](https://github.com/rahul1947/LP4-PERT-Enumeration-of-Topological-Orders)  | Nov 25, 2018 | Enumeration of all Permutations (Recursion, Single Swap, and in Lexicographic Order), and Combinations. Enumeration of all Topological Orderings on a Directed Graph. Enumeration of all Paths in a connected Graph. Evaluates Critical Path using PERT Algorithm. | 
| [LP5: Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms](https://github.com/rahul1947/LP5-Minimum-Spanning-Tree-Algorithms)  | Dec 09, 2018 | Implementation of MST Algorithms - 1. Prim's Algorithm (with 3 versions - PriorityQueue<Edge>, PriorityQueue<Vertex>, and IndexedBinaryHeap<Vertices>) and 2. Kruskal's Algorithm on Connected Graphs. |
